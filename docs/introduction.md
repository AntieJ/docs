Dark is a language and framework for building web backends: REST API endpoints,
asynchronous background workers, scheduled jobs, and persistent storage.
Dark's framework is tightly coupled to the infrastructure, and as you write
code you're able to develop from real incoming requests/traces.

*Note: for now, Dark is only supported for Chrome with browser extensions disabled.*

## Learning Dark

Above, you can see the simplest app in Dark: the hello world app. It
shows starting with an empty canvas, creating a HTTP endpooint (`GET
/hello`), running code (`"Hello world"`) and opening that page.

### Support

We provide support via the [Dark Community
Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer
questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community
members are also around to offer helpful suggestions.
