Dark is a language and framework for building web backends: REST API endpoints,
asynchronous background workers, scheduled jobs, and persistent storage.
Dark's framework is tightly coupled to the infrastructure, and as you write
code you're able to develop from real incoming requests/traces.  Dark is *only
supported* for Chrome *without* browser extensions. (Other browsers do not yet
have all of the features we need. Browser extensions often interfere).

## Learning Dark

Above, you can see the simplest app in Dark: the hello world app. It shows
starting with an empty canvas, creating a HTTP endpooint (GET /hello), running
code ("Hello world") and opening that page.

### Support

If you need support, the [Dark Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite) is the best place for front-line support. Weâ€™re very responsive during the day, and often responsive at all hours.
