We're going to take you through a tutorial to build an entire application that
uses Dark's basic functionality. This should take between 10m and 45m,
depending on how thorough you are.

To start, open _darklang.com/a/USERNAME-gettingstarted_ in another
window. This will open the Dark editor on your first _canvas_.

To see a completed version of this tutorial, go to
[https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted](https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted).
Note that you should **not** copy/paste this &ndash; we want to teach you to
use the Dark editor.

### Support

If you'd like some help, come to the [Dark Community
Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer questions,
