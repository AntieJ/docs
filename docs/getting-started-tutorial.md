## Tutorial: Getting Started

Hello!

Welcome to Dark. We highly recommend trying this getting started project to setup an API + data storage first &ndash; it will get you through all the key concepts including Trace Driven Development, Live Values, and the Structured Editor.

## Canvas

Go to *darklang.com/a/USERNAME-gettingstarted*. This is your first *canvas*, that you edit with the *Dark editor*.

To see a completed version of this tutorial, go to [https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted](https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted). Note that you should **not** copy/paste this &ndash; we want to teach you to use the Dark editor.


### Support

We provide support via the [Dark Community
Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer
questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community
members are also around to offer helpful suggestions.
