## Overview
Dark's alpha package manager allows re-using Dark functions from other users or canvases. Today, only Dark employees can add functions to the package manager. Packages are named by the creator, package, function, and version and are accessible via autocomplete. 

In the future, packages will be imported vs. being continually accessible, and community members will be able to contribute directly. If you would like to request or contribute a package today, please reach out via Slack.

## Slack Package
The first package in the Dark package ecosystem is for the Slack API. Use these functions from autocomplete (dark/slack/Slack::), the same way you would any other function.
