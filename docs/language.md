- [All functions](https://ops-documentation.builtwithdark.com/?pretty=1).
- The editor supports the language, so **DB::** will bring up all datastore functions, **List::** all list functions, etc. You’ll also see the doc strings in line. That said, a list of all expressions is [available here.](https://ops-documentation.builtwithdark.com/?pretty=1)
- Each expression in the language is versioned independently (**DB::getAll_v3**, for instance). You’ll always have access to the version you are using, and the latest version.
- If you have not used a functional language before, [Functional Aspects of Dark](functional-aspects.md) has an overview of the functional features in Dark (implicit returns, pipelines, pattern matching, and map instead of foreach).
